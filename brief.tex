\section*{Problem}

Although the London Underground has an information system, there is currently
no publicly-available software to track individual trains through the system,
nor is there a way to view the timetable (both planned and predicted) from each
station more than a few trains in advance. This has been done for the National
Rail network, but such a thing has not been attempted for the London
Underground yet.

Such a tracking system would not only be useful for rail enthusiasts, for
example trying to follow a delayed steam service around the network or to
follow a particular train of interest, but would also be very useful for making
a variety of inferences about the network.

The project does not come without its difficulties, however. The main source of
data is from a service called TrackerNet, but this data is cached for up to
thirty seconds in the spec (in practice a little longer) to prevent flooding
the (internally-important) system. The main accurate source of location in this
is the logical signalling block in which the train is located (called a track
code on the London Underground). However, there is no map of where these track
codes are in reality. Finally, there appears to be no common identifier between
the timetable data and the live data.

\section*{Goals and scope}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To produce a software system to track trains throughout the London
    Underground System and store the results of past days
  \item To infer the working timetable for this data by averaging past runs and
    manually test a sample of this for accuracy against a PDF working timetable
  \item To produce a user interface for viewing this data per-station or
    per-train
  \item To expand the system to predict the future arrival and departure times
    of trains, including when forming new services
  \item To produce a topological map of track codes and (if possible) attempt
    to verify its accuracy in some way, and to use this map to further improve
    the predictions
\end{enumerate}

The scope of the main project is goals 1-3. Goals 4 and 5 are stretch goals, in
case the main project is completed sooner than expected as additional tasks to
increase the usefulness of the system.
